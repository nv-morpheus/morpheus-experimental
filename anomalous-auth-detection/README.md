## Detection of Anomalous Authentication using Relational Graph Neural Network (RGCN)

## Use Case
Detection of anomalous authentication on Azure-AD signon using Relational Graph Neural Network (RGCN)

### Version
1.0

### Model Overview
Azure active directory (Azure-AD) is an identity and access management service, that helps users to access external and internal resources such as Office365, SaaS applications. The Sign-in logs in Azure-AD log identifies who the user is, how the application is used for the access and the target accessed by the identity [1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-sign-ins). On a given time ùë°, a service ùë† is requested by user ùë¢ from device ùëë using authentication mechanism of ùëé to be either allowed or blocked. For in detail explanation refer the following page of the [Microsoft azure-sign-in](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-sign-ins)

Similar works on anomalous authentication detection includes applying blackbox ML models on handcrafted features extracted from authentication logs or rule-based models. This workflow closely follows on the success of heterogenous GNN embedding on cyber application such as, fraud detection [[2](https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3272010),[5](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol15/p427-rao.pdf)], cyber-attack detection on prevalence dataset [[3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08986)]. Unlike earlier models, this work uses heterogenous graph for authentication graph modeling and relational GNN embedding for capturing relations among different entities. This allows us to take advantage of relations among users/services, and at the same time avoids feature extracting phase. At the end the model learns both from structural identity and unique feature identity of individual users. 
The main motivation behind this work is to tackle the drawbacks of rule-based or feature based system, such as failure to generalize for new attacks and the requirements for dynamic rules that need to be maintained often. An evolving attack and connected anomalous users across the network are hard to detect through feature/rule-based methods. Additionally, using graph approach minimizes efforts on feature engineering tasks.

This model shows an application of a graph neural network for anomalous authentication detection in Azure-AD sign-inn heterogeneous graph. An Azure-AD sign-in dataset it includes four types of nodes, authentication, user, device and service application nodes are used for modeling. A Relational graph neural network (RGCN)  is used to identify anomalous authentications.

### Model Architecture
It uses a  heterogeneous graph representation as input for RGCN. Since the input graph is heterogenous, an embedding for target node "authentication" is used for training the RGCN classifier. The model is trained as binary classifier with task to output "success" or "failure" to each authentication embedding.

### Requirements 
To run this example, additional requirements must be installed into your environment. A supplementary requirements file has been provided in this example directory.

```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training
#### Training data

A training data consists of 1.5K authentication event, with label indicating either failure or success. The dataset is simulated to resemble Azure-AD sign on events. The RGCN is trained to output embedded representation of authentication out of the graph and binary classification of each authentication. 
#### Training epochs
30

#### Training batch size
1000

#### GPU model
Tesla V100-SXM2

#### Model accuracy
AUC = 0.75 (RGCN binary classifier)
Accuracy = 0.85


### How To Use This Model
This model is an example of an authentication detection pipeline using a graph neural network. This model requires an authentication graph such as Azure-AD sign-in logs with four nodes as main entities (user, service, device, authentication) and "statsFlag" for semi-supervision as its main core. The "authentication" node is the target node for training/prediction.

### Input
Authentication data with nodes including user, authentication, device and service.

### Output
An anomalous score of authentication indicates a probability score of being anomaly. A threshold of e.g 0.49 could be used to output produce "benign"
or "fraudulent" authentication.

#### Out-of-scope use cases
This model version is trained on a simulated Azure-AD sign-on logs schema, with entities (user, service, device, authentication) and "statsFlag" as requirement.
