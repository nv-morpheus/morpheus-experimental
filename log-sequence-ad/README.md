# Model Overview

### Description:
The model is a sequence binary classifier trained with a vector representation of the log sequence of the BGL dataset. The task is to identify abnormal log sequences of alerts from a sequence of normally generated logs. This work is based on the model developed in the works of [[2](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9671642),[3](https://github.com/hanxiao0607/InterpretableSAD)], for further detail refer the paper and associated code at the reference link. <br>
