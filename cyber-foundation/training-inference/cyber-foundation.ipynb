    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "General-purpose large language models (LLMs) are helpful in many fields, but specialized domains often need bespoke models. General-purpose LLMs struggle to generate a large amount of realistic synthetic logs, especially with raw logs that differ significantly from natural language. Traditional LLMs need more specificity to handle the structured format of machine-generated logs like JSON. \n",
    "Using general models for generating synthetic logs can miss unique patterns and complexities, reducing the effectiveness of cybersecurity training and simulations. Specialized cyber language models trained on raw logs can better capture these intricacies, improving the precision and effectiveness of cybersecurity measures. The fields may differ for each setting, even if they are of the same log type. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our research focuses on the benefits of using such specialized models to enhance cybersecurity efforts."

    "## Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, the primary goal is to train a GPT model from scratch from raw logs and to generate synthetic logs. Users can expand this use case for various downstream tasks, such as those listed below. \n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging these models, users can enhance their cybersecurity efforts and improve overall system resilience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The associated scripts are taken from this [repo](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT). We chose this repo because it has very few dependencies and allows us to easily change the model size and hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows that a small GPT2 size model is enough to learn the specifics of raw cyber logs and generate realistic synthetic logs. Users could use this approach for potential downstream tasks:\n",
    "1. Generating realistic training data: \n",
    "   The structure of logs can differ from setting to setting. A model trained with propriety data can generate realistic logs true to the setting and incorporate them into future model retraining cycles, helping reduce false positives. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generating attack behaviour to test detectors:**\n",
    "   Cyber-specific language models can simulate cyber-attacks. This is important for testing the effectiveness of alerts and defenses against threats."

    "## Dataset and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use a synthetic dataset of 3239 Azure Active Directory logs with activities of 20 accounts in `JSON` format for demonstration purposes. \n",
    "Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) logs are used for monitoring and managing the security, health, and performance of Azure AD environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the preprocessing script, these logs are converted to `jsonlines` format to train the model effectively on the specifics of cyber logs, and meta files are generated for the training. The `jsonlines` format enabled the model to generate logs with line breaks, which makes using the generated logs easier. The preprocessing script is from the same [repo](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT)."
