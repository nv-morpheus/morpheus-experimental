# Background
Transaction fraud is
[expected to exceed $43B by 2026](https://nilsonreport.com/articles/card-fraud-losses-worldwide/)
and poses a significant challenge upon financial institutions to detect and prevent
sophisticated fraudulent activities. Traditionally, financial institutions
have relied upon rules based techniques which are reactive in nature and
result in higher false positives and lower fraud detection accuracy. As data
volumes and attacks have become more sophisticated, accelerated machine and
graph learning techniques become mandatory and is a more proactive approach. 
AI for fraud detection uses multiple machine learning models to detect anomalies
in customer behaviors and connections as well as patterns of accounts and
behaviors that fit fraudulent characteristics.

Fraud detection has been a challenge across banking, finance, retail and
e-commerce. Fraud doesn’t only hurt organizations financially, it can also
do reputational harm. It’s a headache for consumers, as well, when fraud models
from financial services firms overreact and register false positives that shut
down legitimate transactions. Financial services sectors are developing more
advanced models using more data to fortify themselves against losses
financially and reputationally. They’re also aiming to reduce false positives
in fraud detection for transactions to improve customer satisfaction and win
greater share among merchants.

As data needs grow and AI models expand in size, intricacy, and diversity,
energy-efficient processing power is becoming more critical to operations in
financial services. Traditional data science pipelines lack the necessary
acceleration to handle the volumes of data involved in fraud detection,
resulting in slower processing times, which limits real-time data analysis
and detection of fraud. To efficiently manage large-scale datasets and deliver
real-time performance for AI in production, financial institutions must shift
from legacy infrastructure to accelerated computing.

The Fraud Detection AI workflow offers enterprises an end-to-end solution using
the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform for GPU-accelerated data processing
and AI deployment, enabling real-time analysis and detection of fraudulent
activities. It is important to note that there are several types of fraud.
The initial focus is on supervised credit card transaction fraud. Other areas
beyond fraud that could be converted to products include:New Account Fraud,
Account Takeover, Fraud Ring Detection, Abnormal Behavior, and Anti-Money
Laundering.
