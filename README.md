# Morpheus Experimental

Morpheus Experimental is a staging/collaboration/experimental area for development. This directory contains prototypes of cybersecurity workflows and pipelines which are still being developed and are in the alpha testing stage.

Prototype contributions from the community are welcome. A prototype should include at minimum a tutorial-style notebook, model file, sample data, training script, inference script, and documentation. More information can be found in the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Getting Started

We recommend building morpheus experimental from source in an environment with a modern GPU with at least 16GB of memory.

### General Requirements
- Pascal architecture 16GB GPU or better
- [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install)


### Clone the Repository

```bash
MORPHEUS_EXPERIMENTAL_ROOT=$(pwd)/morpheus-experimental
git clone https://github.com/nv-morpheus/morpheus-experimental $MORPHEUS_EXPERIMENTAL_ROOT
cd $MORPHEUS_EXPERIMENTAL_ROOT
```

### Prototype Specific Requirements
To get started with a specific prototype additional requirements must be installed into your environment. Each prototype directory contains its own `requirements.txt` file. 

```bash 
cd ${MORPHEUS_EXPERIMENTAL_ROOT}/${PROTOTYPE}
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the morpheus pipeline for the prototype follow the instructions for setting up your morpheus environment found in the [main morpheus repo](https://github.com/nv-morpheus/Morpheus#getting-started-with-morpheus)


# Current Cybersecurity Workflow Prototypes

## [DGA Detection via AppShield](https://github.com/nv-morpheus/morpheus-experimental/tree/main/appshield-dga-detection)
This model is a convolution neural network model trained to classify URL domains generated by Domain-Generation-Algorithms. Domain generation algorithms (DGA) are algorithms seen in various families of malware that are used to periodically generate a large number of domain names that can be used as rendezvous points with their command and control servers. Input data comes from AppShield.

## [Phishing URL Detection via AppShield](https://github.com/nv-morpheus/morpheus-experimental/tree/main/phishing-url-detection)
This model is a binary classifier to label phishing URLs and non-phishing URLs obtained from host process data. Input data comes from AppShield.

## [Syslog Resemblance Grouping](https://github.com/nv-morpheus/morpheus-experimental/tree/main/syslog-resemblance-grouping)
This technique syntactically groups system log messages and finds group representatives for data exploration and triage.


# Repo Structure
Each prototype has its own directory that contains everything belonging to the specific prototype. Directories can include the following subfolders and documentation:

## models

Model files for public release (ONNX preferred to pytorch/tensorflow)

## datasets

Samples of training data and inference dataset with model output to be used to test training and inference scripts. Links to  publicly available datasets are also welcome.

## training-tuning

A script and python notebook showing how to train or fine-tune the model. The tutorial-style notebook takes sample training data file as an input and creates a model file. It is reliable and repeatable (ie. set seed values). If variables are used in script (ie. epochs, learning_rate) set defaults to those used to achieve metrics reported in documentation. It includes a `requirements.txt` file with dependencies and versions used for training. 

## inference

A non-morpheus pipeline script that contains data loading, preprocessing, model loading, inference, postprocessing, and serialized output file. It uses desired morpheus pipeline variables as input variables to the script (ie. threshold=0.6). It produces a reliable and repeatable output file from the inference dataset. It includes `requirements.txt` file with dependencies and versions used for non-morpheus inference.

## morpheus-pipeline (optional)
All the necessary files for a full Morpheus pipeline of the prototype similar to pipelines found in [Morpheus Examples](https://github.com/nv-morpheus/Morpheus/tree/branch-22.09/examples) with it's own `requirements.txt` files.
